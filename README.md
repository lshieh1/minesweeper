# Minesweeper Proposal  
## What is Minesweeper?  (Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)  
The goal of the game is to find all the mines by not clicking on them.  I have wanted to build a minesweeper game for a while.  I love playing minesweeper.  It is the only game I have continuously played since high school.

## Initial thoughts on game structure  (Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
I’m thinking of having two layers.  The bottom layer is the squares with all the numbers and bombs while the top layer is all the buttons.  Of course, the top’s behavior is all dependent on the bottom layer.  I will write a class for each square and have a list of the squares saved in a double array in the board.  I have to use random to be able to generate a new board everytime the games starts or restarts.  I imagine the challenges will include being able to organize all the information needed.

## Phases of Completion  (The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)  
Drawing out the board

writing out classes and functions

writing all the eventhandlers (for the many kinds of buttons)

the algorithms or clearing buttons that are 0, and calculating how many bombs around each square
