# Minesweeper Proposal  
## What is Minesweeper?  (Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)  
The goal of the game is to find all the mines by not clicking on them.  I have wanted to build a minesweeper game for a while.  I love playing minesweeper.  It is the only game I have continuously played since high school.

## Initial thoughts on game structure  (Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)

There will be the initial board and when the buttons are clicked the numbers will appear.  I initially was thinking of doing two layers, but I think just saving the numbers within values in the js instead will make it easier.  There will be a class for the square and board itself.  The board will contain the squares.  A challenge will probably be creating the board with the numbers preset with random.

## Phases of Completion  (The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)  
Drawing out the board

writing out classes and functions

creating the imaginary board with the numbers and bombs randomly

writing all the eventhandlers (for the many kinds of buttons)

the algorithms for clearing buttons that are 0, and calculating how many bombs around each square

## Technologies Used
-JavaScript
-HTML/CSS

## Unsolved Problems
-When you click anywhere on the board after dying or winning, it goes back to a smiley face.
